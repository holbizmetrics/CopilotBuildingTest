# Copilot Instructions for CopilotBuildingTest

## Repository Overview
This is the CopilotBuildingTest repository, a test project for evaluating GitHub Copilot functionality and best practices.

### Purpose
This repository serves as a sandbox environment to:
- Test and validate GitHub Copilot agent features
- Experiment with Copilot instructions and configurations
- Demonstrate best practices for Copilot integration
- Provide a reference implementation for Copilot setup

### Technology Stack
- Primary focus: Documentation and configuration
- Version control: Git/GitHub
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions (as configured)

## Project Structure
- `README.md`: Main repository documentation
- `.github/`: GitHub-specific configuration and workflows

## Development Guidelines

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Review this copilot-instructions.md file for project guidelines
3. Follow the development workflow described below

### Code Style
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments only when necessary to explain complex logic

### Testing
- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Ensure all tests pass before committing changes
- Follow existing test patterns and conventions

### Git Workflow
- Create descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages when applicable

### Documentation
- Keep README.md up to date with project changes
- Document any new features or significant changes
- Include usage examples where helpful

## Best Practices
- Make minimal, surgical changes to fix issues
- Preserve existing functionality unless specifically asked to change it
- Test changes thoroughly before committing
- Follow the principle of least surprise

## Copilot-Specific Guidelines

### When Working with Copilot
- Provide clear, specific instructions in issues and pull requests
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain the "why" behind changes
- Leverage Copilot for repetitive tasks and boilerplate code
- Review and validate all Copilot-generated code before committing

### Expected Behavior
- Copilot should follow the guidelines in this document
- Changes should be minimal and focused on the specific issue
- All modifications should maintain existing functionality
- Documentation should be updated alongside code changes

## Troubleshooting
- If builds fail, check for uncommitted changes or missing dependencies
- For test failures, review recent changes and their impact
- Consult existing documentation and commit history for context
- When in doubt, ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
